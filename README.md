#Customer Churn
Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using a company’s product or service. Retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.
This project builds an machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn using Telco Customer Churn data from Kaggle, enabling businesses to identify at-risk customers and take proactive retention measures.
This project uses logistic regresion model as they are more interpretable and used this for making optimal business strategy
Also to enhace churn prediction Random forest classifier is also used.


#credit card:This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a distance-based machine learning algorithm (K-Nearest Neighbors) by leveraging similarity between transaction patterns.Dataset used is credit card fraud detection from Kaggle

The project focuses on:
Handling severely imbalanced data
Applying distance-based learning
Evaluating models using appropriate fraud-specific metrics
